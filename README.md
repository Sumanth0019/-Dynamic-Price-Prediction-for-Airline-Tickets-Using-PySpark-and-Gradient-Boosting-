##  Objective

Build a machine learning pipeline that leverages **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** for predicting dynamic airline ticket prices. Compare scalability and accuracy between **PySpark-based** and **Scikit-learn-based** implementations.

##  Abstract

The airline industry relies on **dynamic pricing** to maximize revenue. Traditional models like Random Forests often struggle with large datasets and scalability.

The airline industry tends to depend on dynamic pricing for revenue maximization in response to 
demand. Predicting flight ticket prices traditionally employs machine learning techniques, including 
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, and Decision Trees. However, these techniques often fail to 
appropriately and efficiently model large-scale volume data while providing a measure of high 
predictive accuracy. In this study, we present our Scalable Dynamic Pricing Model via Extreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) solving the problems with two configurations: a configuration with 
distributed processing using PySpark and the other configuration for baseline comparison without 
PySpark. 


This project introduces a **Scalable Dynamic Pricing Model** using **XGBoost**, with two configurations:
- **Standalone (Scikit-learn + Pandas)**
- **Distributed (PySpark MLlib)**

Key results:
-  XGBoost (Pandas): **R¬≤ = 0.9786**
-  XGBoost (PySpark): **R¬≤ = 0.9954**, improved scalability and reduced computation time

In addition, an **Integer Pricing Module** is developed for real-world deployment by adjusting prices based on seasonality and competition.

## Importance of Flight Price Prediction

-  **Passengers**: Helps find the best time to book
-  **Travel Agencies**: Boost customer trust with better recommendations
-  **Airlines**: Optimize revenue while staying competitive
-  **Data Scientists**: Extend research on demand forecasting
-  **E-commerce / OTAs**: Enhance user retention with smarter pricing
